# OOP-Project
# Abstract
Every system needs management to operate normally. So does a hospital for it’s smooth work flow. To keep its data intact and accessible, this program has been made. Just think because of data mishap, how many people can end up going to wrong medical specialist. How many appointments would not have taken place just because of slow flow of data. Thus, we applied the knowledge of C++ OOP gained in class to make a program that covers up such problems in an hospital, clinic, dispensary, etc.

# Introduction of your project
The project is designed to manage record of three main bodies of a hospital. Through this project, keeping records and their safety is easy. This project provides a clean user interface for patients, doctors, and administration. Doctors can track down their patients, upcoming appointments, and departments, etc. Vice versa for patients. Administration can easily manage other bodies through this.

# Methodology/ Plan development to solve the Problem

We applied the knowledge we gained in object-oriented programming. The main three modules of this management system are: • Administration Module. • Doctor Module. • Patient Module. All these modules will have login, add, view and deleting functionalities. Data will be handled by file handling.

Administrator Module: ● Sign in to system ● Add a Doctor ● Add a Patient ● Add an appointment ● View all patient details ● View all doctor details ● View all appointment details ● Delete data 2)Patient Module: ● Sign in to system ● Add an appointment ● View appointments 3)Doctor Module: ● Sign in to system ● View patients ● View appointments

# Specifications

We have used different libraries for various purposes.
Bool datatype has been used to keep a check on the conditions on various points.
We have used global variables that are common in different classes and functions, for ease of accessing and using.
Classes have been used for each members with different member functions for functionality. Concepts of inheritance have been demonstrated in the project.
File handling is done to manage and store all data records.
For choice choosing interface, if-else statements and switch statements have been used.
Goto statement has been used to go back to homepage purpose.

# Results Discussion

When programs start, user sees such interface. The user can register himself or herself. Login as a patient, doctor, or admin. Or ultimately close the program. The reason for choosing red color on white background is that this color coordination a norm in medical field. The login entries are set as default: Username: adminadmin Password: 1234 When logged in successfully as an admin, there are options related to admin like adding data of doctors or admin, viewing the data or delete the data. As, we have logged in as admin and checked that there are no doctors available, the programs ask us to add doctors for appointment. Moving onward, let’s try to register as a patient Upon selecting registration, we can see that program asked us to enter name, password, gender and age. Upon entering data, the program gave us patient ID through random function. Demonstrating delete function. Exiting program. Invalidity is given upon wrong login.

# Conclusion

This project is computerizing the work in a hospital, it is more convenient than the manual system. The computerization makes the managing process fast, safe and reliable. The program is thoroughly checked by entering dummy data, it worked as per the requirement, performing all functions. The program is great for a small, normal hospital. In future it can have features like surgery record management, pharmacy management, research management, blood and organ donation management, equipment management and salary management, etc.
